# 04_insulin_core_regulation

This module analyzes the differential impact of reduced insulin signaling on core insulin pathway components in OSNs and Fatbody tissues.

## Overview

This figure combines four analytical components:
1. Venn Diagram of significantly regulated insulin core genes (common vs unique).
2. Pairwise Scatter Plot showing directional regulation (log2FC OSNs vs Fatbody).
3. GO Enrichment analysis and Visualisation using `GO_enrichment_circlize.R`.
4. Reactome-style Pathway Schematic highlighting affected genes and regulation direction.
